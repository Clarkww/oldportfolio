Hi, my name is Clark Wheeler, and I'm a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional websites and web applications.
            
            
I'm relatively new to web development, but I've already gained experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive web design, and React. 
I love learning new things and exploring different approaches to web development, 
and I'm excited to continue growing my skills and knowledge.
            
           
            
In addition to my technical skills, I'm also a creative thinker and problem solver. 
I enjoy working with clients and users to understand their needs and come up with innovative solutions that meet those needs.
I believe that good design is about more than just aesthetics
it's about creating user experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable.
            
            
           
When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors or indulging in my love of music and art. 
I'm a firm believer in the power of creativity and curiosity to inspire new ideas and perspectives, both in life and in web development.
            
Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
